						In my first year at Upang, I created a digital clock project using Python and its built-in tkinter library. The project displays the current time and updates it every second.
						<br>
						<br>
						My digital clock project was a simple GUI application that displayed the current time and updated it every second. I used Python's tkinter library to create the clock's user interface. The update_time method was responsible for updating the time displayed on the clock. The main method created a Clock object and started the main event loop.

						In my second year, I decided to create an Android e-commerce app using Java for our project. I started by downloading and installing Android Studio and creating a new Android project with the "Empty Activity" template.
						<br><br>
						The project is an Android e-commerce app that allows users to browse and purchase products from various categories. The app features a user-friendly interface, MySQL database, and ContentProvider for product data. Users can create an account, log in, search for products, and make purchases. The app was developed using Android Studio and follows best practices for Android development.<br><br><br>

						In my second year, I decided to create a Django-based e-commerce website for our project. I started by installing Django and creating a new Django project. I then designed the website's user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I added a Django app for handling product listings and another app for handling user accounts and authentication.
						<br><br>
						The project is a Django-based e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase products from various categories. The website features a user-friendly interface, MySQL database, and Django views and templates for displaying product listings and user account information. Users can create an account, log in, search for products, and make purchases. The website was developed using Django and follows best practices for web development, including modular design, clean architecture, and unit testing.
